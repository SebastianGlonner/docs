# Unit tests CheatSheet

- FAST, FASTER, the most fastest possible
ALWAYS write your tests fast even if it takes extra effort
and/or more coding lines, whatever.
You will stop executing slow tests and in this case you do not need to write
tests at all.

- thus writing UNIT tests, testing small units of the code and creating
tests for each unit separately

- Easy tests! The tests has to be easy to read and understand!
favour DAMP over DRY

- Think decoupled, consider using dependency injection whenever useful / possible

- Try behaviour driven test names, reading the tests gives information of the purpose / functionality of the software

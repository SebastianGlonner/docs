# Why using coding style guidelines

- keep code more maintainable
- keep code transparent, sane, and readable
- thus ease introduction for new team members
- help less skilled programmers to get skilled programmers
- help to maintain code quality even so there are working less skilled programmers

# What should coding style guides be / not be

- following the guidelines should result in "better" code (@see scrollTop())
- the rules should NOT exist just to style the code itself,
  of course unless it improves readability
- but you want to define rules helping developer understand code with ease
  because the first upper case letter tells us that this is an object/class
  with an constructor i want to call.

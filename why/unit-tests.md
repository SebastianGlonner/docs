# Why do unit tests

- can act as and or repalce documentation, thinking about:
 - behaviour driven tests

- test driven development might be easier and faster development:

 - e. g. the never tested exception which fails cause never tested.
This actually might save time considering the whole game because searching
these small issues a view weeks / month later might take more time than
just testing it now.

 - in some cases automated tests run faster than reloading the webpage or
restarting the server etc.

- improve developer skills and improve code quality because
fast and good test cases requires to think more decoupled and component like

- automated tests is near to automated test data. Which might save tons of time
if dont have to create test data by hand

- easier introduction for new developers

- saver, faster introduction of new features

- saver, faster refactoring, performance opting
